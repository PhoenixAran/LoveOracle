v0.8.0
==========
[API]: Make Update and Draw functions private.
[Android]: Receive feedback and make fixes to errant behavior. Applies to issue #35.
[Frame]: API calls to setup frames (child regions in Dear ImGui). Can hook into Regions module and expose some functionality from this for this feature. #46.
[LayoutManager]: Right aligned controls are flush on the edge. Should flush with the window border.
[Mouse/Keyboard]: Allow multiple 'Update' calls. This will conflict with the async input processing. Might need to keep a cache of the last async update and always apply that to every 'Update' call.
